Various Code Snippets on different topics about Python

1. [namedtuple_benchmark]
   (namedtuple_benchmark.py)

    An example of comparison between namedtuple and dict assignment. Shows the
    cost of readability of namedtuples over dict's integer index.

2. [mmap]
   (mmap)

   Examples on how to use mmap module in python. Includes reading, writing (using slices and only in memory a.k.a. ACCESS_COPY) and regex finds. The example comes from [PYMOTW article on mmap](http://pymotw.com/2/mmap/).

3. **Sorting**

    Code snippets demonstrating various sorting algorithms implemented in
    Python. See [tests.py](tests.py) for written tests.

  1. [merge_sort]
     (merge_sort.py)
3. **Color in terminal**

4. Requests - Requests-futures
    
    A small example in terms of demonstrating the parallelization of
    requests-futures package.
    [Syncronous example](requests/synchronous_code.py) using plain requests and [Asyncronous
    example](requests/asynchronous_code.py) using requests-futures
